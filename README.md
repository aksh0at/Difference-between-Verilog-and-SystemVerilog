Verilog is a traditional hardware description language primarily used for modeling, designing, and simulating digital circuits at the RTL level. It is widely used for basic hardware design and synthesis but offers limited support for advanced verification.

SystemVerilog is a powerful extension of Verilog that combines design and verification in a single language. It introduces modern features such as object-oriented programming, constrained-random test generation, assertions (SVA), interfaces, enhanced data types, and reusable testbench architectures. These features make SystemVerilog the industry standard for building scalable, automated, and coverage-driven verification environments.

👉 In short, Verilog is mainly design-oriented, while SystemVerilog is both design- and verification-oriented, making it essential for modern VLSI workflows.
